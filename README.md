THIS IS DIGITAL WEB CLOCK

USING HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jquery)

HTML Structure: The HTML file defines the structure of the digital clock UI. It includes a container for the clock display, with separate elements for hours, minutes, and seconds.

Inline CSS Styling: CSS styles are applied directly to the HTML elements using inline CSS. This includes styling for the clock container, digits, and dividers to create a modern and visually appealing design.

JavaScript (with jQuery): JavaScript code handles the real-time functionality of the clock. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation to update the clock display every second. The updateClock() function retrieves the current time and updates the text content of the hours, minutes, and seconds elements accordingly.

Real-Time Clock Update: The setInterval() function is used to call the updateClock() function every second, ensuring that the clock display reflects the current time accurately.
